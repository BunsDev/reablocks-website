# Ellipsis
The Ellipsis component is designed to manage long strings of text by truncating them and optionally allowing users to expand the text to view in full. 
This component is particularly useful for maintaining a clean UI when dealing with potentially lengthy content such as descriptions, comments, or articles.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
#### Expandable Text Section
In this example, the text is truncated with an ellipsis, 
and users can click on the ellipsis to reveal the hidden text:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={EllipsisStories.Simple} />

#### Unexpandable Text Section
For cases where the full text should not be expanded within the component 
but is visible via a tooltip on hover:
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={EllipsisStories.Unexpandable} />

## API
The `Ellipsis` component offers flexibility through several properties that adjust its behavior and presentation:
<PropsTable name="Ellipsis" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Content Access:** Ensure the full content is accessible through interaction (click to expand) or tooltips, preventing loss of critical information.
- **Adaptive Text:** Adjust the amount of truncated text based on the context and importance, ensuring key information is always visible to the user.
