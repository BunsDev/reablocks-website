# Setup
This section will guide you through the initial steps required to integrate Tailwind CSS into your project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can be customized to fit the design needs of your project. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth setup.

      <Steps>
      ### 1. Initialize reablocks
      Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and use the reablocks-cli to initialize reablocks in your project:
      ```sh copy
      npx reablocks-cli@latest init
      ```

      ### 2. Include Tailwind

        If you already have Tailwind included, you can skip this step.
      </Callout>
      After installing Tailwind CSS, you need to inject its styles into your project. Do this by adding Tailwind's directives to your main CSS file. These directives include `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`. Here's how:
      -  Open or create your main CSS file. This file is typically located at `src/index.css` or `src/styles.css`.
      -  Add the following Tailwind directives at the top of your CSS file:


      ```css copy
      @tailwind base;
      @tailwind components;
      @tailwind utilities;
      ```
      **Result:** These directives inject Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes into your stylesheet, making them available throughout your project.

      ### 3. Initialize Theme Provider
      Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component from `reablocks`. 

      ```tsx copy
      import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'reablocks';

      // NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.
      
      export const App = () => (
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <YourComponents />
        </ThemeProvider>
      );
      ```

      You can learn more about the `ThemeProvider` [here](/docs/theme/getting-started).

      ### 4. Setup Storybook
      Optionally: If you are using Storybook, you can setup the reablocks in Storybook by adding the 
      following code to `.storybook/preview.js`:

      ```javascript copy
      import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
      import { ThemeProvider, theme } from "reablocks";

      export const decorators = [
        Story => (
          // NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.
          <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
            <Story />
          </ThemeProvider>
        )
      ];

      const preview: Preview = {
        // Your other configurations here too
        decorators: [withProvider],
      };
      ```

      You can learn more about the Storybook setup [here](/docs/getting-started/storybook).

    </Steps>
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>
    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      If you already have Tailwind installed, you can skip to step 4.
    </Callout>

    <Steps>
    ### 1. Installing Tailwind CSS
    Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run the following command:
    ```sh copy npm2yarn
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```

    ### 2. Initialize Tailwind
    Still in the terminal, initialize Tailwind CSS by running:
    ```bash copy
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

    **Result:** This command creates a `tailwind.config.js` and a `postcss.config.js` file in your project root.

    Add the reablocks package from your node modules to the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

    ```javascript copy
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
        './node_modules/reablocks/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    };
    ```

    ### 3. Include Tailwind
    After installing Tailwind CSS, you need to inject its styles into your project. Do this by adding Tailwind's directives to your main CSS file. These directives include `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`. Here's how:
    -  Open or create your main CSS file. This file is typically located at `src/index.css` or `src/styles.css`.
    -  Add the following Tailwind directives at the top of your CSS file:


    ```css copy
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
    **Result:** These directives inject Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes into your stylesheet, making them available throughout your project.

     ### 4. Configure Tailwind
    Configure default colors tokens (primary, secondary, success, etc) in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

    ```javascript copy
    import colors from 'tailwindcss/colors';
    import plugin from 'tailwindcss/plugin';
    import { colorPalette } from 'reablocks';

    const config: Config = {
      content: [
        './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
        './node_modules/reablocks/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {
          colors: {
            primary: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.blue[500],
              active: colorPalette.blue[500],
              hover: colorPalette.blue[600],
              inactive: colorPalette.blue[200]
            },
            secondary: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.gray[700],
              active: colorPalette.gray[700],
              hover: colorPalette.gray[800],
              inactive: colorPalette.gray[400]
            },
            success: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.green[500],
              active: colorPalette.green[500],
              hover: colorPalette.green[600]
            },
            error: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.red[500],
              active: colorPalette.red[500],
              hover: colorPalette.red[600]
            },
            warning: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.orange[500],
              active: colorPalette.orange[500],
              hover: colorPalette.orange[600]
            },
            info: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette.blue[500],
              active: colorPalette.blue[500],
              hover: colorPalette.blue[600]
            },
            background: {
              level1: colorPalette.white,
              level2: colorPalette.gray[950],
              level3: colorPalette.gray[900],
              level4: colorPalette.gray[800],
            },
            panel: colorPalette['black-pearl'],
            surface: colorPalette['charade'],
            typography: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette['athens-gray'],
            },
            accent: {
              DEFAULT: colorPalette['waterloo'],
              active: colorPalette['anakiwa']
            },
          }
        }
      },
      plugins: [
        plugin(({ addVariant }) => {
          addVariant('disabled-within', '&:has(input:is(:disabled),button:is(:disabled))');
        })
      ]
    };

    export default config;
    ```

    ### 5. Install Reablocks

    ```sh copy npm2yarn
    npm install reablocks --save
    ```

    ### 6. Initialize Theme Provider
    Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component from `reablocks`. 

    ```tsx copy
    import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'reablocks';

    // NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.
    
    export const App = () => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <YourComponents />
      </ThemeProvider>
    );
    ```

    You can learn more about the `ThemeProvider` [here](/docs/theme/getting-started).

    ### 7. Setup Storybook
    Optionally: If you are using Storybook, you can setup the reablocks in Storybook by adding the 
    following code to `.storybook/preview.js`:

    ```javascript copy
    import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
    import { ThemeProvider, theme } from "reablocks";

    export const decorators = [
      Story => (
        // NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.
        <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
          <Story />
        </ThemeProvider>
      )
    ];

    const preview: Preview = {
      // Your other configurations here too
      decorators: [withProvider],
    };
    ```

    You can learn more about the Storybook setup [here](/docs/getting-started/storybook).

## Example Repository
You can use the following [repository](https://github.com/goodcodeus/starter) to get started with Reablocks.

## Developing Locally

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development environment. To run it locally:

- **Clone the repository.**
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:reaviz/reablocks.git
```
- **Install dependencies.**
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash copy
npm install
```
- **Start Storybook.**
Once the installation is complete, start the Storybook development server:

```bash copy
npm start
```

**Result:** This command runs Storybook locally and opens it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:9009.` You can now view your components, experiment with their properties, and see changes in real-time.

### Building for Distribution with Rollup
Our project uses Rollup for bundling and preparing the package for distribution. To build the project, simply run:

```bash copy
npm run build
```
**Result:** This command generates a `dist` folder containing the bundled JavaScript, CSS files, and type definitions, ready for deployment or distribution.
