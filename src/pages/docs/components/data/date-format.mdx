# Date Format
The Date Format component simplifies the process of converting standard date formats into more readable forms or formats tailored to the user's locale preferences. 
Leveraging the capabilities of [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns) flexibility in displaying dates in both absolute and relative terms.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
For straightforward applications, the component can directly format the current date and time into a default format.
<ToggleCanvas sourceState="shown" of={DateFormatStories.Simple} />

### Relative Time
The component also supports displaying dates in relative terms, such as "3 months ago", which can be particularly useful for content timestamps.
<ToggleCanvas sourceState="shown" of={DateFormatStories.Relative} />

## API
The `Date Format` component is highly configurable with several properties to adjust its behavior and output format:
<PropsTable name="DateFormat" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **User Preference:** Allow users to select their preferred date format settings if possible, catering to global audiences and personal preferences.
