# Empty State

The Empty State blocks are useful when a component has no data to display. This is a common scenario when a user has just signed up or has not yet created any content.

## No Results
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.NoResults} />

## Missing Info
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.MissingInfo} />

## Nothing to Display
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.NothingToDisplay} />
